Welcome to the Data Science Repository for Gungahlin College!

This is a fairly new Repo and we'll be adding new data sets often. If you'd like to contribute datasets, email Jim. Don't forget to attribute each set to the original authors!

Remember, when using the datasets in this system you NEED to use the RAW DATA link, otherwise Panda's won't like it!
